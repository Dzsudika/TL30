<p>
Deliver fast, engaging and reliable experiences is key for customers. Having the reach and accessibility of a web page on mobile is even better as customer are using mobile for daily activities. 
Building a mobile application is not just a mean to achieve a great digital transformation, it's key for customer retention.
 
Marketing and Technical teams have faced many challenges since a decade to build compelling mobile experiences: technical adoption of platforms specific languages (Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android), 
poor user experience for mobile applications built onto cross platforms engine (Phonegap, Xamarin...).
