## Technical Lab 30 : Building a Progressive Web Application with AEM

**Lab overview** 

 
Marketing and Technical teams have faced many challenges since a decade to build compelling mobile experiences: technical adoption 
of platforms specific languages (Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android), poor user experience for mobile applications built onto 
cross platforms engine (Phonegap, Xamarin...). The issue remained the same:  **How can we build web apps that look and feel like 
native mobile apps for iOS and Android?**

This question has been answered by Google Engineering Teams: Build Progressive Web Applications.PWA will help marketers deliver fast, 
engaging and reliable experiences for customers on mobile. Having a PWA is not just a mean to achieve a great digital 
transformation, it's one of the key factor for customer retention and brand intimacy.
